## Daily Task Prioritizer 🗃
A Python mini-project that helps you organize your tasks by priority.
You enter tasks one at a time, assign a priority level, and the program sorts everything for you.

✨ **Features**
* Adds unlimited tasks
* Choose priority levels:
   - 1 = High 
   - 2 = Medium
   - 3 = Low

* Automatically sorts tasks from most to least important
* Clean, user-friendly console output
* Handles invalid input with helpul messages
* Provides a summary of your tasks


🚀 **How To Run**
From project folder:
python3 daily_task_prioritizer.py

You'll be prompted:
Task name (or press Enter to finish):
Priority (1 = high, 2 = medium, 3 = low):

Enter as many tasks as you want, then press **Enter on a blank line** to finish.


🧠 **Skills Demonstrated**
* Python functions
* Sorting with lambda
* Lists & tuples
* User input handling
* try/except error handling
* Clean, structured code design


*Example Output* ✨
